# MeDAL dataset

![](./figures/rs_illustration.svg)

Repository for **Me**dical **D**ataset for **A**bbreviation Disambiguation for Natural **L**anguage Understanding (MeDAL), a large medical text dataset curated for abbreviation disambiguation, designed for natural language understanding pre-training in the medical domain. It was published at the ClinicalNLP workshop at EMNLP.

<!-- ðŸ¤— [Pre-trained ELECTRA Small (Hugging Face)]()

ðŸ”¥ [Pre-trained LSTM (Torch Hub)]() -->

## Quickstart

<!-- COMING SOON
### Using Torch Hub

You can directly load LSTM and LSTM-SA with `torch.hub`:
```python
import torch

lstm = torch.hub.load("BruceWen120/medal, "lstm")
lstm_sa = torch.hub.load("BruceWen120/medal, "lstm_sa")
```

If you want to use the Electra model, you need to first install transformers:
```
pip install transformers
```
Then, you can load it with `torch.hub`:
```python
import torch
electra = torch.hub.load("BruceWen120/medal, "electra")
```

-->

### Using Huggingface `transformers`

If you are only interested in the pre-trained ELECTRA weights (without the disambiguation head), you can load it directly from the Hugging Face Repository:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("xhlulu/electra-medal")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("xhlulu/electra-medal")
```


## Running the code
